# Stencil App Starter

## Getting Started

To start this project using Stencil, clone this repo to a new directory and install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

after that run:

```bash
npm start
```

## Notes

This project includes a component that can be manipulated in the file to change the display of the component (image-text). On the '.tsx' file you can change the position of the text when you change the state of line 22. By default it's 'left', but you can change to 'right'
```bash
@State() textPosition: 'left' | 'right' = 'left';
```
